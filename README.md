I got excited about advent calendars while doing Advent of Code this year, so I made my own!

This one doesn't give you chocolate when you open a day, but it does give you a link to something fun/silly every day.

Enjoy!

## Code Notes

Made with React and this time I used npm instead of yarn for fun. 

It also uses localStorage to save your progress per device. There's a button to reset it if you want.

## Note to self
If gh-pages looks way smaller than when you use the vscode testing version:  

It might be because you're zoomed in on Chrome! Duuuuh! hahaha.  I took more time than I needed to in finding that out.
